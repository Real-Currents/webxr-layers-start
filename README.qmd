This is a simple starter app for a WebXR Layers project. I've seen some examples where developers in-the-know effortlessly incorporate WebXR Layers into their app, some of which are sampled here, but I haven't come across any demonstrating a practical boiler plate and usage of WebXR Layers with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js). This is my attempt...

## Configuration

This project uses vite to build/bundle/package/etc. the WebXR app. The `vite.config.js` configuration also depends on the `@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl` plugin so that the dev server will use the HTTPS protocol which is required for entering immersive mode on most web browsers. Install all required dependencies with `npm install`

## Running Code

Run `npm run dev` to run the WebXR dev server.

```

  VITE v5.4.11  ready in 293 ms

  ➜  Local:   https://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

```
